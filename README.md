# Machine learning by Stanford University (Coursera)

Exercises done during the machine learning by Standford University on Coursera. My intention uploading this material is not to offer a free-to-copy repository of all the exercises but to publish my work so that future students have an extra support to check their exercises once done or to get a general idea of how to solute the proposed problems if they get stucked.

I want to thank the oportunity and documentation given during this course because it was really extensive and comprehensible. I'm specially thankful to Andrew NG for being so clear in all the different videos and for making high-level concepts easy to understand.
